## LED Chaser

I made this little board just for fun, a classic 555 timer driving a row of LEDs.
The potentiometer controls how fast they blink, and I added a USB-C port because… well, why not keep even a simple circuit a bit fancy? [:

*It has a cosmic touch on the front and my name in Arabic on the back.*

A custom development board I built to make learning with the ESP32 simpler and more fun (:
It’s mainly for students who just want to code, test their ideas, and play with IoT or cloud stuff, without fighting with cables or trying to find components in school lab (:
Just plug it in, write some code, and have fun watching things come to life...

or more details on what the board supports, you can check the schematic here:

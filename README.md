# Fun PCB projects (:

* LED chaser with USB-C connector
* ESP32 module Shield board.


## LED Chaser

A simple PCB project built around a 555 timer IC and a potentiometer to control the blinking speed. Powered through a USB-C connector for convenience.

An experimental ESP32 module board designed to connect multiple peripherals, including:

* TFT screen
* DHT11 sensor
* Push buttons
* Buzzer


This board is meant as a multi-purpose experimental platform for trying out different IoT and embedded projects using the ESP32.
